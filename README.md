# E-commerce Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of an e-commerce store using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Overview

The analysis was performed using a Jupyter Notebook and involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, handling missing values, and performing data cleaning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance using various Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
3. **Insights and Conclusions**: Summarizing the key insights derived from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

Running the Notebook
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd ecommerce-analysis
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook ecommerce_analysis_project.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis.
Data Files
The CSV files required for this analysis are not included in this repository. You will need to provide your own data or obtain the dataset used in this project.

Dataset Structure:
The analysis expects the dataset to have the following structure (example):

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order
Product: Name or description of the product
Quantity Ordered: Number of units sold
Price Each: Price per unit
Order Date: Date and time of the order
Purchase Address: Address where the order was delivered
Ensure your dataset is structured similarly to avoid issues while running the notebook.

Results
Some of the key insights from the analysis include:

Sales Trends: Identification of peak sales periods.
Customer Behavior: Analysis of purchasing patterns and customer demographics.
Product Performance: Insights into best-selling products and revenue generation.
